# Possible questions the simulation could answer
- [ ] Max amount of yearly/monthly withdrawal on retirement to reach certain age with certain probability.
- [ ] Given a withdrawal amount, probability of reaching certain age
- [ ] Age broke with certain probability
- [ ] Probability of being broke at certain age (e.g. Graph.  age vs prob-broke)
- [ ] 2 sigma range of: ageBroke, retirement money, etc.
- [ ] Questions could be answered in two ways, at my target retirement age, or at my current age.
- [ ] What's the best portfolio according to simulation.  This would be an optimization problem (maybe too complex)
- [ ] Modify the range of market data to consider for volatility calculations
- [ ] Allow user to choose and retrieve online data through market related API
- [ ] Graph ageBroke
- [ ] Graph safe retirement amount (i.e. money I expect to have either as a 2 sigma or at a certain confidence probability)
